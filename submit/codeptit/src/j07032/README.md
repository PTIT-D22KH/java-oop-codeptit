## j07032

To understand the problem statement based on the provided code, let's break down the functionality of the code step-by-step:

1. **Reading Data from Files**:
   - The code reads two lists of integers from two files named `DATA1.in` and `DATA2.in` using `ObjectInputStream`.

2. **Checking Palindromic Odd-Digit Numbers**:
   - The `check` function determines if a number is a palindromic number with all odd digits and an odd number of digits.
   - A number is considered valid if:
     - All its digits are odd.
     - It has an odd number of digits.
     - It reads the same forwards and backwards (palindromic).

3. **Finding Common Valid Numbers**:
   - The code iterates through the first list (`arr1`) and checks if each number is present in the second list (`arr2`) and satisfies the `check` function.
   - If both conditions are met, the number is added to a `TreeSet` (which automatically sorts the numbers and removes duplicates).
   - The process stops once 10 such numbers are found.

4. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The code counts how many times each of these valid numbers appear in both lists combined.
   - It uses an array `a` to keep track of the counts.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, the code prints each valid number and its count.

### Inferred Problem Statement:
Given two lists of integers from two files, find up to 10 common numbers that are palindromic, have all odd digits, and have an odd number of digits. For each of these numbers, count their occurrences in both lists and print the number along with its count.

### Example:
If `DATA1.in` contains `[135, 151, 313, 12321, 12345]` and `DATA2.in` contains `[151, 313, 12321, 54321]`, the output should be:
```
151 2
313 2
12321 2
```

### Code Explanation:
```java
package vao_ra_file;

import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.ObjectInputStream;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.TreeSet;

public class J07032 {
    static boolean check(int n) {
        int tmp = n, m = 0, c = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            int k = n % 10;
            if (k % 2 == 0) return false; // Check if digit is even
            c++;
            m = m * 10 + k; // Reverse the number
            n /= 10;
        }
        if (c % 2 == 0 || c < 3) return false; // Check if number of digits is odd and at least 3
        return m == tmp; // Check if the number is palindromic
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        ObjectInputStream ois1 = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("DATA1.in"));
        ObjectInputStream ois2 = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream("DATA2.in"));
        ArrayList<Integer> arr1 = (ArrayList<Integer>) ois1.readObject();
        ArrayList<Integer> arr2 = (ArrayList<Integer>) ois2.readObject();
        TreeSet<Integer> ts = new TreeSet<>();
        int a[] = new int[1000003];

        // Find common valid numbers
        for (Integer i : arr1) {
            if (arr2.contains(i) && check(i)) ts.add(i);
            if (ts.size() >= 10) break;
        }

        // Count occurrences in both lists
        for (Integer i : arr1)
            if (ts.contains(i)) a[i]++;
        for (Integer i : arr2)
            if (ts.contains(i)) a[i]++;

        // Print results
        for (int i : ts)
            System.out.println(i + " " + a[i]);
    }
}
```

This code reads two lists of integers from files, finds up to 10 common numbers that are palindromic with all odd digits and an odd number of digits, counts their occurrences in both lists, and prints the results.
